If you wish to run this app, you need to manually modify filePath1, filePath2, combination and the filepath for writeFile in App.java to the filepath of the two csv files you wish to compare, the unique combination you use as the reference and the output filepath of the result. Note that although the order of the labels in the unique combination doesn't matters, they should be selected from the first row at both csv files you wish to compare.
